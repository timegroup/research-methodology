\textbf{\sc Automated monitoring of Ambiguous  street parking dues .}\\
\end{center}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{•}
This document proposes the development of an automated monitoring of Ambiguous street parking bills .The system shall focus on how car owners will access their street parking dues ,in a clear summarised but well organised form .This shall erase any Suspicion, as all the information shall be at their(car owners) exposal .
  
\section{BACKGROUND}
\paragraph{•}
Multiplex Limited Uganda is a private civil construction company and street ticket parking company. Multiplex Limited records information about cars parked on kampala streets, stores the data collections in a database that can be accessed by their cilents from their offices or use mobile phones through mobile money that only shows the a specific block amount to be paid. This could result into denial of payment or furiously storming multiplex offices in need of knowing ,the ambiguous accumulation of parking dues .Generally causing inconveniences to car owners and multiplex officers ,in the struggle to explain accumulation of dues or the reason for having clumped a car .

\subsection{Problem statement} 
Continuous doubt in bills to foot accumulated due to street parking, leaves a lot of car owners with in Kampala disenfranchised from access to clear reports by Multiplex Limited. This arises from current poor report generation, which lacks the ingredient to convince defaulters with a breakdown summary of how the total amount due arises. A remedy to monitor bills would rather erase ambiguity with this current system.

\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{•}
The development of a web based database that will capture parking details, provide data security, help administrators to monitor bills, give online guidance on how to pay their bills for car owners parking on Kampala streets.
