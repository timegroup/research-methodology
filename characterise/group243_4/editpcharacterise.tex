\textbf{\sc Automated monitoring of Ambiguous street parking dues.}\\
\end{center}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{•}
This document proposes the development of an automated monitoring of Ambiguous street parking bills. The system shall focus on how car owners will access their street parking dues, in a clear summarised but well organised form. This shall erase any Suspicion, as all the information shall be at their(car owners) exposal and clear for their interpretation.
  
\section{BACKGROUND}
\paragraph{•}
Multiplex Limited Uganda is a private civil construction company and street ticket parking company. Multiplex Limited records information about cars parked on kampala streets, stores the data collected in a database that can be accessed by their cilents from their offices or use mobile phones through mobile money that only shows the a specific block amount to be paid at a time. This could result into denial of payment or furiously storming multiplex offices in need of knowing, the ambiguous accumulation of parking dues .Generally causing inconveniences to car owners and multiplex officers, in the struggle to explain accumulation of dues or the reason for having clumped a car.
